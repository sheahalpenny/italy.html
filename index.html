    <h1> Italy </h1>
      <p>Italy is a dream destination for people world-wide, whether itâ€™s kids fresh out of high school looking to study abroad, newlyweds looking for a romantic honeymoon, or retirees looking to travel in their golden years. Its extensive history, beautiful sceneries, and rich culture make Italy a popular vacation spot. </p>

      <p>However, no country is perfect; Italy has its fair share of issues. Italy began with a dictatorship under Benito Mussolini, which nearly destroyed the country. After WWII, the government put in place was the democratic republic system, which helped the country revive its economy and its people. </p>

      <p>Italy has been a member of NATO sine the end of the 20th century. While Italy may be plagued by the same issues that haunt any country (ex. crime, unemployment, pollution, etc.), it is still a country full of life and history, making it a desired vacation destination and a beautiful place to live. </p>
